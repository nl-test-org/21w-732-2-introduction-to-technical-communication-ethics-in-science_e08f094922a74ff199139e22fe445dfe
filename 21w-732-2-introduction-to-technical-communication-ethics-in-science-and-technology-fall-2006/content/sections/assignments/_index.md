------------------------------------------------------------------

### Reading Response

Read Alvin Weinberg's "Can Technology Replace Social Engineering?"

Write a one-page response: The author discusses a number of practical obstacles to using technology to solve social problems. Ignoring these, are there any ethical obstacles that would, or should, prevent technology's capacity to solve social problems? Why or why not?

Base your response on a particular social problem of contemporary society for which one or more technological solutions exist, and discuss whether the technological fix is also ethical or not.

### Cover Letter & Resume

Write a one-page letter suitable for an academic or professional environment. The letter can be an application letter for a job, internship, or an undergraduate research position. Also prepare a resume to go along with this letter. Please single space this assignment.

### Abstract

Read Kevin Warwick's "Cyborg morals, cyborg values, cyborg ethics."

Write an abstract for the article based on the guidelines we discussed in class. For this case, it should be between 100 and 200 words. We will look at the actual abstract in class on the day this assignment is due.

### Presentation Visual Aid

Bring an example of a complex visual aid and be ready to give a one-minute explanation of it.

### Memo 1: Environmental Memo

Read Rachel Carson's "The Obligation to Endure."

Assume the role of an employee of one of the large chemical corporations that manufacture pesticides.

Your task is to evaluate Carson's essay and prepare a memo to a team of managers that responds to the essay and recommends specific actions-either in support of or in opposition to (or a combination) Carson's points. Be sure to summarize Carson's key points in the memo.
